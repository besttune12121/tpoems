            <div class="poem-line">I’m sorry for the moments lost,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">For the lines I crossed, the heavy cost.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">I see the strength you carry through,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">The way you rise, the things you do.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">In every step you take alone,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">I see a heart that’s fully grown.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">You manage life with grace and might,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">A shining star in the darkest night.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">You’ve shown me what it means to stand,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">To face the world, to make a plan.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">And here I am, learning still,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">To hold my words, to bend my will.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">I’m sorry for the times I’ve slipped,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">For the pain I may have tipped.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">But know that in your quiet grace,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">I see a hero, I see your place.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">You carry burdens I can’t see,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">Yet you move with dignity.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">I marvel at the way you live,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">The love you show, the strength you give.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">So here’s my heart, my truth, my plea,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">I’m sorry for what’s come from me.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">But in your light, I find my way,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">And in your strength, I see the day.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">You’re doing great, you’re standing tall,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">And through it all, you never fall.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">I admire the life you’ve made your own,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">In you, a queen has clearly shown.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">So take this note, this heartfelt line,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">I’m sorry for where I’ve failed to shine.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">And know that as you journey through,</div>
